I'm looking for a new maintainer!

If you're a user of this plugin, don't worry: I'm still keeping an eye on it, and I'll try to make sure it keeps working fine with future versions of Dokuwiki. But my time is now dedicated to other projects so I will likely not add other features.

If you're interested in maintaining this plugin, just send me an email (adress available in the commit log) and I'll make sure to give all the information you will need.
